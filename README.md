#WIP-main
This is the main repository of my unblocked games website, WIP. 
To make a new Url for yourself:

1: OpenÂ https://github.com/WIP43/WIP43.github.io

2: Look in the top right corner and click fork

3: Name it whatever & make it public

4.Open Settings and scroll down until it says pages on the left side bar and click it

5: Look for the Branch subsection, then click the word none and change it to main and then click save.

That's it, you now have your own URL.

**Remember to sync it to the main repository every once in a while to keep everything fresh and get any updated I may add.**
